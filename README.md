# SOULVST3
A simple 12 voice poly-synth with powerful modulation capabilities.
Uses [SOUL](https://github.com/soul-lang/SOUL) as the core audio engine and [blueprint](https://github.com/nick-thompson/blueprint) for the UI

Very much in the early stages but here's a [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h5zlbocSoh9f5A_hQ65-RYCbrNokWoVc/view?usp=sharing) of progress so far
